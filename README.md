# Sudoku
Developed a Sudoku program using Python that randomly generates a 9x9 Sudoku board of varying degrees of difficulty, revealing a possible solution to the board when the user wishes.

# How it was built
This application was programmed entirely in Python and used a backtracking algorithm to calculate the Sudoku board solution.
